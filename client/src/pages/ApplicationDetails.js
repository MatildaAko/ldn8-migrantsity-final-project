cover_letter: "I am writing to express my interest in the product designer position that you have posted. I believe that my experience as a product designer and my passion for the field make me an ideal candidate for this position.\n\nI have been working as a product designer for the past five years, first at XYZ Company and then at ABC Company. My work has included designing products for both consumer and industrial markets. I have designed everything from kitchen appliances to medical equipment. I have also worked on projects ranging from small-scale prototypes to full-scale production models.\n\nMy experience has taught me how to work with clients of all types, including marketing teams, engineers and manufacturing staff. I have learned how to communicate effectively with all of these people in order to create products that meet their needs while still being marketable and profitable. I have also learned how to manage budgets and schedules so that products are completed on time and within budget.\n\nOne of my greatest strengths is my ability to think creatively. I am able to come up with new ideas for products that will be successful in the marketplace. I am also able to take existing ideas and improve them so that they are more appealing to consumers. This skill has allowed me to help companies increase sales by as much as 30 percent through my designs alone.\n\nI would like the opportunity to meet with you in person so that we can discuss my qualifications in greater detail. I am confident that my skills and experience will allow me to be an asset to your company."
